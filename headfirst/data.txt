This playbook assumes the following:

You're on a Network that has access to the internet.
The network you're on does NOT have DHCP (you can disable installing DHCP on the helper).
The ocp4-helpernode will be your LB/DHCP/PXE/DNS and HTTP server.
You still have to do the OpenShift Install steps by hand.
I used CentOS 7/8, but RHEL 7/8 will work as well.
You will be running the openshift-install command from the ocp4-helpernode.
Below is a highlevel diagram how the ocp4-helpernode fits into your network.
